## Moltivation
We read in a CNA article that Singaporean workers opt for snacks over proper meals due to high stress work environments. This would mean consumption of food like confectionery like chocolates, sweets and savoury snacks like nuts and popcorn,  sacrificing on intake of crucial nutrients like proteins and carbohydrates. Diving deep into statistics, we also learnt from a 2022 Health promotion board survey that nine in ten people in Singapore are consuming salt above the recommended level, as well as the rate of hypertension doubling since 2010. 

We feel that health should never take a backseat, especially in high-pressure, demanding environments. This belief of ours inspired us to create an application that empowers individuals with the tools and the motivation they need to take control of their well-being while juggling their studying and working responsibilities and aspirations. 

The productivity application Forest took the world by storm ever since it was released. Despite its initial launch more than ten years ago, it remains a sensation in the App store, still retaining the #1 spot in the productivity section. Through the application, users are each given a garden, the number of trees that grow in their garden is in proportion to the time they stay focused in their work-related endeavours. The more dedicated they are, the more their garden flourishes, allowing users to be rewarded for consistent effort and discipline. 

Inspired by the success of forest in reinforcing self-improvement habits in its user base, we hope to introduce a similar system for our users, where users get to cultivate their own garden through consistently achieving their health and exercise goals. Through achieving milestones, users will be able to earn in-app accessories and rewards which can be used to decorate their avatar and garden respectively. By gamifying the notion of productivity, we hope to encourage users to stay motivated, build healthy habits and visualize their progress in a meaningful way. We want to keep the journey interesting and refreshing for users, one they will never feel the urge to give up on. 

Pokemon Go, as a success story, also inspired us to go further with our ideas. Pokemon Go brought in novel geological concepts into gaming, where users explore their real life surroundings to collect exotic Pokemons and diversify their collection, imbuing an additional layer of adventure. It is evident that Singaporeans are captivated by the unique experience that Pokemon Go provides, as seen in the massive turnout in Pokemon Go official events, with the most recent iteration amassing over 18000 people at the venue. As such we hope to incorporate geological-based functions to our application as well, where users will get to explore their real-world surroundings and get points and accessories for doing so. Users will be rewarded the more steps they take and for exploring new food options in their area. We hope to emulate the unique Pokemon Go experience into the mechanics of our application. 

Through gamification, real-world exploration, and personalized rewards, we hope to encourage individuals to take charge of their health while keeping the journey engaging and rewarding. In a competitive, ever-changing and fast-paced world where well-being is often sidelined, our application serves to remind everyone that self-care can go hand in hand with oneâ€™s responsibilities and that health and oneâ€™s well being is a key to living a balanced and fulfilling life.
